  # This string construction must starts and ends from "\" characters,
  # then in parenthesis should be patter string and then, after the last
  # "\" can be specified flag option (like this: "/(your-pattern)/s")
  # e.g. ("/(word)/i".as-regex).matches "WORD" return TRUE
  # other flags:
  # /d - Enables Unix lines mode.
  # /i - Enables case-insensitive matching.
  # /x - Permits whitespace and comments in pattern.
  # /m - Enables multiline mode.
  # /s - Enables dotall mode.
  # /u - Enables Unicode-aware case folding.
